# RAG System Testing Guide

## üéØ What We're Testing

**The Problem We Fixed**: AI agents were failing with "No valid content generated by any agent" when using RAG insights because the converter function wasn't handling undefined properties safely.

**The Solution**: Added defensive checks to `convertRAGToEnhancedInsight()` function to ensure all properties have safe defaults.

**Expected Result**: AI agents should now generate 3 content variations successfully using RAG insights with 99.6% smaller context (858KB ‚Üí ~3KB).

## üß™ Testing Options

### Option 1: Railway Production Testing (Recommended - Fastest)
Test the deployed system directly via API calls.

### Option 2: Local Worker Service Testing  
Run the worker service locally with environment setup.

### Option 3: Next.js Frontend Integration
Test through the main application's content generation.

## üöÄ Option 1: Railway Production Testing

### Step 1: Check System Status
```bash
# Check if Railway deployment is healthy
curl -X GET https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/health

# Check environment variables
curl -X GET https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/env
```

**Expected Response**: 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "environment": {
    "hasOpenAIKey": true,
    "hasSupabaseUrl": true,
    "hasRedisUrl": true
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Check Embeddings Database
```bash
# Check if we have Andrew's post embeddings
curl -X GET https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/embeddings-stats
```

**Expected Response**: Should show ~100 embeddings for Andrew's posts.

### Step 3: Test Vector Similarity Search
```bash
curl -X POST https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/vector-similarity \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "leadership challenges for CEOs"}'
```

**Expected Response**: 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "found_posts": 5,
    "posts": [
      {
        "post_id": "...",
        "similarity_score": 0.85,
        "engagement_score": 150,
        "content_preview": "Most CEOs won't admit this..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test RAG Historical Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/rag-historical \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "leadership challenges for CEOs"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": {
    "similar_posts_found": 5,
    "avg_engagement": 150,
    "prediction_confidence": 85,
    "context_size_kb": 3
  }
}
```

### Step 5: üî• CRITICAL TEST - AI Agents with RAG
```bash
curl -X POST https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/ai-agents-rag-debug \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "leadership challenges for CEOs"}'
```

**‚úÖ SUCCESS Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "AI agents with RAG insights test completed",
  "resultsCount": 3,
  "ragInsightsStructure": {
    "hasTopPerformers": true,
    "topPerformersCount": 5,
    "hasPatterns": true,
    "hasVoiceAnalysis": true
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "agentName": "andrew_tallents_agent_1",
      "hasContent": true,
      "contentLength": 350,
      "historicalContextUsed": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚ùå FAILURE Response**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "AI agents failed with RAG insights",
  "details": "Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"
}
```

### Step 6: Complete Production Flow Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://linkedin-ai-content-worker-production.up.railway.app/debug/production-data-rag \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "leadership challenges for scaling businesses"}'
```

**Expected Response**: Should show 3 successful AI agents with content generated.

## üñ•Ô∏è Option 2: Local Worker Service Testing

### Prerequisites
Create `.env` file in `/worker-service/` directory:
```env
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY="your-firecrawl-api-key"
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
NODE_ENV="development"
WORKER_CONCURRENCY="1"
MAX_JOB_ATTEMPTS="3"
```

### Step 1: Start Local Service
```bash
cd /Users/tommyrichardson/Cursor/LinkedIn-AI-Content-Andrew-Tallents-clean/worker-service
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Locally
Use same curl commands as above but with `http://localhost:3001` instead of Railway URL.

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/debug/ai-agents-rag-debug \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "leadership challenges"}'
```

---

## üåê Option 3: Next.js Frontend Testing

### Step 1: Start Next.js App
```bash
cd /Users/tommyrichardson/Cursor/LinkedIn-AI-Content-Andrew-Tallents-clean
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Create Content Generation Job
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/content/generate-async \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "topic": "leadership challenges for CEOs",
    "platform": "linkedin"
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "uuid-here",
  "message": "Content generation job queued"
}
```

### Step 3: Monitor Job Progress
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/content/job/YOUR_JOB_ID
```

**Expected Progression**:
1. `status: "queued"`
2. `status: "processing", progress: 25` (Research phase)
3. `status: "processing", progress: 50` (Historical analysis)
4. `status: "processing", progress: 75` (AI generation)
5. `status: "completed", progress: 100` (Done)

### Step 4: Check Final Results
Final response should include:
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "progress": 100,
  "drafts": [
    {
      "agent_name": "andrew_tallents_agent_1",
      "content": {
        "title": "Andrew Tallents Post 1",
        "body": "Most CEOs won't admit this: they've become the bottleneck...",
        "estimated_voice_score": 95
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ Success Criteria Checklist

### ‚úÖ System Working Correctly If:
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Embeddings database has 100+ entries
- [ ] Vector similarity finds 5+ similar posts
- [ ] RAG insights generate without errors
- [ ] **AI agents return 3 content variations** (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Context size reduced to ~3-20KB (was 858KB)
- [ ] No "Cannot read property" errors
- [ ] Generated content includes Andrew's authentic voice patterns

### ‚ùå Issues to Debug If:
- [ ] RAG insights conversion fails
- [ ] AI agents return empty results or error
- [ ] Property access errors in logs ("Cannot read property 'length' of undefined")
- [ ] Context size still large (>100KB)
- [ ] Only 1-2 agents succeed instead of 3

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Application not found" on Railway
**Solution**: Railway deployment might be down. Try local testing or wait for redeployment.

### Issue: "No valid content generated by any agent"
**This was our main issue - should be fixed now**
- Check logs for property access errors
- Verify converter function has all defensive checks
- Test with minimal topic like "leadership"

### Issue: "No similar posts found"
**Solution**: 
- Check embeddings database has data: `/debug/embeddings-stats`
- Try broader topics: "leadership", "business", "CEO"
- Re-populate embeddings if needed: `POST /debug/populate-embeddings`

### Issue: OpenAI API errors
**Solution**:
- Check API key is valid: `/debug/env`
- Verify OpenAI account has credits
- Try with smaller context/simpler prompts

---

## üìä Performance Metrics to Track

### Context Size Reduction:
- **Before**: ~858KB per job
- **After**: ~3-20KB per job  
- **Reduction**: 99.6% smaller
- **Token Savings**: ~214,000 tokens per job

### AI Agent Success Rate:
- **Target**: 3/3 agents generate content successfully
- **Previous**: 0/3 agents (all failed)
- **Expected**: 3/3 agents with RAG insights

### Content Quality:
- Voice score should be 85-95 (high authenticity)
- Content should include Andrew's patterns (vulnerability, CEO coaching, etc.)
- Should reference historical performance insights

---

## üéâ What Success Looks Like

When everything works correctly, you should see:

1. **Vector search** finds Andrew's similar posts
2. **RAG insights** extract patterns from high-performing content  
3. **Converter** safely transforms RAG data to AI-agent format
4. **AI agents** generate 3 LinkedIn posts using historical insights
5. **Content** matches Andrew's authentic voice and proven patterns
6. **Context** is 99.6% smaller while maintaining quality

The key fix was adding defensive null checks like:
- `ragInsight.voice_analysis?.tone || 'professional'`
- `(ragInsight.similar_posts || []).map(...)`
- `ragInsight.patterns?.avg_word_count || 150`

This prevents the "Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" errors that were breaking the AI agents.
